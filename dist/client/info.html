    <h1 style='text-align: center'>What are tropical and sidereal zodiacs, and what are their differences?</h1>

    <p>So what exactly are tropical and sidereal zodiacs? Tropical and sidereal are different ways to determine one's zodiac sign.The first one, tropical zodiac is tied to the seasons and calendar dates, while sidereal continues to go off of the position of the sun and constellations. The reason for this change is because of how much easier it is for us to go off of Originally, tropical and sidereal were the same, with the Aries season starting on the spring equinox, however now (~2,000 years later) the spring equinox actually happens while the Sun is in Pieces. This is due to precession.

        </div>

        And this change was caused by presession.
