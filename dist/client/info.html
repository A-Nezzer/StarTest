    <h1 style='text-align: center'>Sidereal vs Tropical Zodiac Signs</h1>

    <p>
        A very long time ago, people created astrology by studying the motions of the heavens. A person's zodiac sign was determined by what constellation the Sun was in front of when they were born. Ranges of birthdates were recorded for each constellation of the zodiac. However, these dates should have been updated over time, because the Sun isn't in the exact same place on the same day each year. It appears to move eastward ever so slightly. Over a long period of time, this can add up to a big difference! It's enough that most people's sidereal sign is shifted over one from their tropical sign. In astronomy, the phenomenon that causes this shift is called axial precession. You can learn more about this <a href='https://www.space.com/zodiac-sign-astrology-astronomy' style="color:#FFFFFF;">here.</a> In addition, the tropical zodiac simply divides the sky into twelve equally sized chunks, regardless of the fact that some constellations are larger than others. By using constellation borders defined by the International Astronomical Union, we can precisely divide the sky into different chunks based on the actual size of each sign.

        <h1 style='text-align: center'>Ophiucus: The 13th Sign</h1>
        <p>
            Another key difference is the existence of the 13th zodiac sign: the constellation Ophiucus. The tropical zodiac makes no mention of it, even though the Sun does pass through it for a short time. In fact, some have even argued in favor of having fourteen zodiac signs by including the constellation Cetus.
