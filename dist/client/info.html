    <h1 style='text-align: center'>What are tropical and sidereal zodiacs, and what are their differences?</h1>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Tropical and sidereal are different ways to determine one's zodiac sign.The first one, tropical zodiac is tied to the seasons and calendar dates, while sidereal continues to go off of the position of the sun and constellations. Originally, tropical and sidereal were the same, with the Aries season starting on the spring equinox, however now (~2,000 years later) the spring equinox actually happens while the Sun is in Pieces, and the constellations are shifted almost a full sign. This is due to precession.

        &emsp;&emsp;Another difference that can be seen in the simplification made by tropical, suggesting that all 12 constellations take up the same space (~30&deg;) in the sky. While not all sidereal sources strictly follow the exact position and will make the 30&deg; approximation, our simulation shows the position of the sun on specific days, so that approximation is never made. This also causes an inclusion of a lesser-known constellation, Ophiuchus.

    Using the chart it is slightly easier to see the differences between using sidereal and tropical astrology. For further details, this video made by MasteringTheZodiac goes into the details, as well as <a href=”https://www.space.com/zodiac-sign-astrology-astronomy">this</a> article by Space.com.

    <h1 style='text-align: center'>What is precession? </h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;While rotating around the sun, the Earth is actually tilted. The tilt of the Earth follows a circular path, always staying around 23.5&deg; from the ecliptic, and this path is called precession. The rate of this transit is very slow at ~1&deg; every 72 years, leading to a not really noticeable change of where the sun appears to be rising each year. When considering the thousands of years between now and when astrology was first observed, these changes become more evident.

        <br>

        &emsp;&emsp;Another example of procession in the night sky is the use of Polaris as the North Star. Currently, Polaris is used to approximate the northern direction, as the axis of Earth’s rotation is pointing at the constellation. As Earth’s precession proceeds, the axis begins to move away from Polaris, and in around 12,000 years will point to Vega star.
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;This small amount of rotation builds up over many many years and while we may be around one sign off now, in a few thousand more years the sidereal and tropical signs will be even further off.
